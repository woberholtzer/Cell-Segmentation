# Cell-Segmentation

Worked with class partner Matt Wallace. Assisted by professor Chris Tralie.

This project utilizes the Disjoint Set data structure and watershed segmentation to locate and match pixels of a high brightness threshold. The cells are located and the center of the cell is represented by a green dot.
